# Public API Requests
 
This is the fifth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree. 

For this project, an app was built for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) was used to retrieve information for 12 random employees who are then listed in a grid format with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

I have added buttons to easily move between users info and a search bar that searches the users on the page. I have also added my own background colors to make it my own.
